I love the intuitive design and clean UI!
Too many bugs, I can't get anything done.
It's okay, does the job, nothing extraordinary.
I'm confused by the navigation structure.
The support team was amazing!
Why is this even released? It's broken!
Itâ€™s a bit laggy, but I can work with it.
Absolutely fantastic, exceeded expectations.
The buttons are not responsive on mobile.
Feels incomplete, needs more polish.
